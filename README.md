Using a self-supervised ViT and unsupervised UMAP-KMeans pipeline, we visualized and clustered morphologically distinct regions from AML bone marrow biopsy slides without any pathologist labels. The method successfully separated adipose-rich areas, hypercellular regions, and artifact-prone zones into distinct visual clusters, showing promise for scalable histopathological pattern discovery.
